Mitch went to class this morning. It was cold out and he was uncomfortable. 
After class, he went to the library to do some homework. 
He was then planning on getting some food, but it was still cold out and 
Mitch decided to go home instead.

Right outside his house, Mitch slipped on some ice and landed on his back 
and became paralyzed. One of his roomates saw it happen and ran outside to 
help. His roomate then called the paramedics to come get him. An abulance
arrived and loaded Mitch into the back. He was now regretting not going to
get food.

"Fortunately, I have SHIP insurance, otherwise I have no money for treatment." He thought that.

Mitch made it to the hospital safe and sound and went through many treatments.
Miraculously, he managed to come back to full strength and put the 
even behind him
